# Event Finder
## Android app used to find interesting events.

This is an Android app made using Android Studio, Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It uses Ticketmaster Discovery API to find events in a chosen city. The default city is Tampere and on the homepage of the app, the user can change the city. The city is stored using Jetpack's DataStore so it stays in the memory even when the app is closed. In the 'search' page, the user sees 20 upcoming events. By clicking an event name, the user can see more information about the event. In addition, the user can add the event to their calendar.

The application is available in both Finnish and English.
